Thank you all along our company’s support.  
We would like to let you know the launch Dual Channels LoRa gateway. 
          
Overview: LG02 & OLG02 are open source dual channels LoRa Gateway. They can be used to bridge LoRa wireless network to IP network via WiFi, Ethernet, 3G or 4G cellular. The
LoRa wireless allows users to send data and reach extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity. With LG02/OLG02, user can build a long range wireless IoT solution rapidly. 

LG02 & OLG02 has Rich Internet Connection methods such as WiFi interface, Ethernet port and USB host port. These Interfaces provide flexible methods for users to connect their sensor networks to Internet.
LG02 & OLG02 can support the LoRaWAN protocol in single frequency and customized LoRa transmit protocol. The design of LG02 is using the Linux to directly control two sx1276/sx1278 LoRa modules which lets the LoRa can works in full duplex mode and increase the communication efficiency.

LG02 / OLG02 can be used to provide a low cost IoT wireless solution to support 50~300 sensor nodes.
 
Except LoRaWAN mode, LG02 / OLG02 can support other working on mutiply working mode such as: **LoRa repeater mode, MQTT mode, TCP/IP Client mode, TCP/IP Server mode** to fit different requirement for IoT connection. Click this link for more info about the modes. 
LG02 / OLG02 base on **sx1276** solution which provide a low cost for your IoT network connection. Compare to the cost with normal SX1301 LoRaWAN solution. the LG02 / OLG02 are only of its 1/4 or less cost. This make the LG02 / OLG02 very suitable to set up small scale LoRa network or use it to extend the coverage of current LoRaWAN network.

   --Limited support in LoRaWAN/ Support Private LoRa protocol
   --Support upto 300 nodes
   --LoRa band available at 433/868/915/920 Mhz
   --Max range in LoRa: 5~10 km. Density Area:>500m
 
Typical Applications: 
   --Wireless Alarm and Security Systems
   --Home and Building Automation
   --Automated Meter Reading
   --Industrial Monitoring and Control
   --Long range Irrigation Systems
   --GPS tracker,etc   
   --LoRaWAN repeater

1. To install Jupyter in Raspberry, you can see this:[Installing jupyter in Raspberry PI 3 ](http://www.instructables.com/id/Jupyter-Notebook-on-Raspberry-Pi/), but it would be sufficient this :
    - *sudo pip3 install jupyter* 
    - **jupyter notebook**   
 2. This [openmv software](https://openmv.io/pages/download) is a good start point for the NEW Camera iot.
 3. News from openmv [twitter world].(https://twitter.com/openmvcam)
 4. Time series ,  a data points collected at constant time intervals. [from analyticsvidhya ](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/)

1. NEW Camera iot  [see:](https://openmv.io/).The OpenMV project is about creating low-cost, extensible, Python powered, machine vision modules and aims at becoming the “Arduino of Machine Vision“. Our goal is to bring machine vision algorithms closer to makers and hobbyists. We’ve done the difficult and time-consuming algorithm work for you leaving more time for your creativity.
2. New VisionKit from [Google:](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/).The **AIY Vision Kit** from Google lets you build your own intelligent camera that can see and recognize objects using machine learning. All of this fits in a handy little cardboard cube, powered by a Raspberry Pi.
3. New Voicekit  from [Google:](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/). The *AIY Voice Kit* from Google lets you build your own natural language processor and connect it to the Google Assistant. All of this fits in a handy little cardboard cube, powered by a Raspberry Pi.
