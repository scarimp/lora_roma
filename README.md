1. To install Jupyter in Raspberry, you can see this:[Installing jupyter in Raspberry PI 3 ](http://www.instructables.com/id/Jupyter-Notebook-on-Raspberry-Pi/), but it would be sufficient this :

    - *sudo pip3 install jupyter* 
    - **jupyter notebook**
    
 2. This [openmv software](https://openmv.io/pages/download) is a good start point for the NEW Camera iot.

=========

1. NEW Camera iot  [see:](https://openmv.io/).The OpenMV project is about creating low-cost, extensible, Python powered, machine vision modules and aims at becoming the “Arduino of Machine Vision“. Our goal is to bring machine vision algorithms closer to makers and hobbyists. We’ve done the difficult and time-consuming algorithm work for you leaving more time for your creativity.
2. New VisionKit from [Google:](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/).The **AIY Vision Kit** from Google lets you build your own intelligent camera that can see and recognize objects using machine learning. All of this fits in a handy little cardboard cube, powered by a Raspberry Pi.
3. New Voicekit  from [Google:](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/). The *AIY Voice Kit* from Google lets you build your own natural language processor and connect it to the Google Assistant. All of this fits in a handy little cardboard cube, powered by a Raspberry Pi.
